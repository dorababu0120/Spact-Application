# Spact â€“ Fullstack Todo Task Management Application (MERN)

## Overview
**Spact** is a web application designed to streamline task management for teams and individuals. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), it offers a user-friendly interface for efficient task assignment, tracking, and collaboration. The platform supports both company-level tasks and personal task management, making it ideal for modern work environments.

## Why/Problem?
In todayâ€™s fast-paced workplaces, managing tasks across teams and individuals can quickly become chaotic. Traditional systems like spreadsheets or messaging apps are not scalable and lack structure. **Spact** solves this by offering a centralized system where all usersâ€”admins and regular employeesâ€”can manage their tasks clearly and effectively.

## Background
With increasing adoption of remote and hybrid work, tools like **Spact** are essential. It offers an organized interface built on modern web technologies to help teams collaborate better and stay on top of their work. Its MERN-based architecture ensures scalability, while Redux Toolkit, Headless UI, and Tailwind CSS enhance performance and user experience.
